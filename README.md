This project will use the C# bindings for the RayLib graphic library in order to display diverse things: a simulation and algorithms such As A*, BFS and other. 
This should be seen as a continuation of the Golf project which contains many small Godot projects

Following this will be a full fledged DSA visualizer and Mayb a Zig rewrite.
